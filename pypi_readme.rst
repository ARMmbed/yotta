yotta is a tool that we're building at `mbed <https://mbed.org>`_ to make it
easier to build better software written in C, C++ or other C-family languages.
It's still early in development, so if you have questions/feedback or issues, please `report them on Github <https://github.com/ARMmbed/yotta/issues>`_.

Installation
============
While yotta is written in python, to use it to build software you'll need several non-python dependencies. Detailed installation instructions and links to installers can be found on the `yotta docs site <http://yottadocs.mbed.com>`_.

Get Started
===========
The best way to get started is to `follow the tutorial <http://yottadocs.mbed.com/tutorial/tutorial.html>`_.
